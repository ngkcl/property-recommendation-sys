# property-recommendation-sys
London property recommendation system


To launch the app, upload to heroku (or launch flask server) and pass a property name as query
e.g - http://<url>/recommend?name=<put name or description of property here>
Currently trained on a small part of the airbnb-london dataset, due to memory issues on my pc, could be increased inside the code
