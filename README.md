# property-recommendation-sys
London property recommendation system


To launch the app, upload to heroku (or launch flask server) and pass a property name as query

e.g - http://**your-url**/recommend?name=**name or description of property you want recommendations for**

Currently trained on a small part of the airbnb-london dataset, due to memory issues on my pc, could be increased inside the code
